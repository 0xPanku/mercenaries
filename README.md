# Mercenaries of Efyria

Mercenaries of Efyria is a chaotic collection of 999 unique ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

"No gods, no masters â€” as the saying goes."

They understood it so well, that they engraved it on their souls.
If you have to remember only one thing, then know that you will never be the true master of a mercenary.

You have been warned.

In a kingdom forgotten by the gods, ruled by greedy men, without morals or scruples, wars and skirmishes are commonplace.
In this chaotic context, the free companies and their mercenaries play the game well.
Sometimes highwaymen, local militia or simple cannon fodder, the powerful compete for their services 
but loyalty of these mad dogs is as tenuous as the virtue of a courtesan.
